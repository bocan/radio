## üöÄ Getting Started

### Clone & run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bocan/radio.git
cd radio
# Open index.html in your browser
```

### Customizing Stations

All stations are defined in radio.js.  Finding the raw stream URLs can be tricky. Try inspecting the network requests on the station's web player or searching online. Finding their metadata API (if it's available at all) is even trickier as they won't ever advertise it. The browser's developer tools are your friend here. Even once you find it, everyone does it differently. It could be json, xml, raw text, or even exotic formats, so you'll need to write a custom parser function for each one.

```js
const STATIONS = [
  {
    id: 'groove-salad',
    name: 'SomaFM: Groove Salad',
    location: 'San Francisco, US',
    description: 'Ambient / downtempo beats.',
    streams: [
      { url: 'https://ice1.somafm.com/groovesalad-128-mp3', type: 'audio/mpeg' }
    ],
    metadataUrl: 'https://somafm.com/songs/groovesalad.json',
    parseNowPlaying: data => {
      const s = Array.isArray(data?.songs) ? data.songs[0] : null;
      if (!s) return null;
      return `${s.artist} ‚Äî ${s.title}`;
    }
  },
  // ‚Ä¶ more stations
];

```
To add your own station, append another object to this array.

### üì° Proxies for CORS Metadata Issues

Metadata is tricky because every station does it differently, and many don't do it at all.

Because many metadata endpoints are CORS restricted, some metadata URLs use the author's proxy ‚Äî you
may need a proxy when adding your own metadata endpoints. A real example of this from your author's
web server is:
```nginx
    location /proxy/kiosk {
        resolver 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 valid=300s ipv6=off;
        proxy_pass https://kioskradio.com/api/now-playing ;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_ssl_server_name on;
        proxy_ssl_name kioskradio.com;
        proxy_connect_timeout 5s;
        proxy_send_timeout 10s;
        proxy_read_timeout 10s;
        proxy_set_header Host kioskradio.com;
        proxy_set_header User-Agent "radio-proxy";
        add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://chris.funderburg.me" always;
        add_header Vary "Origin" always;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=15" always;
    }
```
A warning! This is the only potentially sketchy part of this project because you could technically
count this as "scraping" since you're pulling data from their API without permission. Now, as it
stands, they're unlikely to care because it's a tiny amount of traffic, and we're only checking every
15 seconds, but ideally always check the station's terms of service, and if possible reach out to
station.

### üì¶ Deployment

Because this is a static site:

GitHub Pages ‚Üí easiest option

Netlify / Vercel ‚Üí drag-and-drop or link repo

Any static web server (Nginx, Apache, S3+CloudFront, etc.)
